0.13.12 started this file
* Each line in $WILYTOOLS or $HOME/.wilytools can contain 
either a comment (starts with whitespace or '#') or a regexp,
then a tab, then some tools (i.e. some text) which will be put
into the tag of any window whose label matches the regexp.
The _first_ regexp match wins.
