<H6>Notation</H6>
B1, B2 & B3 are left, middle, right mouse buttons, respectively. "B1B2"
means to select some text with B1 held down, then click and release
on B2 while still holding B1 down.  This is the B1B2 chord. There are
others. "Sweep with B1" means to hold down B1, drag it across some text
to select it, and then release B1.

<H6>Screen layout/control.</H6>
The screen is divided into columns, each of which is divided into
windows.  Each window has a scrollbar and a one-line "tag" containing a
file/directory name and some commands. There is also a tag at the top of
each column, and at the top of the whole screen.  A "layout box" is at
the left of each tag: dragging this box with B1 moves the window around
the screen; windows re-layout automatically when you drag and release
windows with this box. Clicking on the with B1 "grows" the window
slightly; B2 makes it grow until all other windows in the column only
show their tags. B3 makes the window tag up the whole column, hiding
other windows completely.

<H6>Selecting and editing text</H6>
Type normally anywhere on the screen to enter text; move the pointer
into the tag/window you want to type into. Position the cursor within
text either with cursor keys, or clicking once with B1. Sweeping text
and then typing Cuts the selected text, and replaces it with the
typed text. Cut and Paste are chords B1B2 and B1B3: sweep text with
B1, and complete the B1B2 chord to delete. B1B3 Pastes text over the
selected text. Double-clicking with B1 selects text quickly, picking
a word, a line, or text delimited by quotes, brackets, braces, or
parentheses, depending on where you double-clicked. Undo and Redo give
edit history. Layout box is filled in when text is modified but not
saved.

<H6>Executing commands</H6>
Sweep text (anywhere!) with B2 to execute it as a command. A single B2
click automatically selects a sensible "word" as the command. Commands
can be built-in (Capital first letters, by convention) or passed to
the shell for invocation. To invoke commands with arguments, sweep the
argument with B1, then click on the command with B2B1.  If a B2 command
begins with |, > or < characters, the B1-selected text is piped through,
fed into or replaced by the results of the command, respectively. Any
output generated by commands appears in a window named dir/+Errors,
where dir is the directory the command was invoked in.

<H6>File/directory management</H6>
Windows show file or directory contents. The full path of the
file/directory is given in the tag. Selecting a filename with B3 (sweep
or single-click) will attempt to open that name relative to the pathname
in the window's tag. The new file/directory appears in a new window. If
the file can't be found, the B3'd text is searched for in the current
window instead. If the B3'd text is of the form ":n", it is a line
number to go to. ":/pattern" is a regular expression pattern to search
for.

<H6>Builtin commands</H6>
Anchor prints current selection address in tag. Clear clears
window. Cut cuts selected text to buffer. Del deletes window. Delcol
deletes column and windows. Dotfiles toggles display of dot files in
directory windows. Font toggles fixed/proportional fonts. Get reloads
window. Indent toggles autoindent. Kill halts named B2'd program. Look
searches for text. New creates new window. Newcol creates new
column. Paste pastes buffer. Put writes file to disk.  Putall writes
all files. Quit exits Wily. Redo undoes last Undo. Snarf copies text to
buffer.  Split opens up another window on the same file. Undo undoes
last edit.
