<!-- documentation for ../include/msg.h ../wily/msg.c -->
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>Although a lot can be done with simple scripts and Wily,
some applications will need finer control.  Wily can act as a
"user interface server".  Clients can create and manipulate 
windows, and/or monitor events which happen in windows,
by sending and receiving messages.

<P>There are two "levels" to the interface:  an "RPC" level,
where the library looks after low-level details of queueing, packing
and unpacking messages, and a lower-level interface dealing more
directly with message packets.

<P><B>Warning</B> this API hasn't been used very much.
There could well be bugs lurking in unused sections of code,
and the API could well change.

<H2>Establishing a Connection</H2>

<P>Call <TT>client_connect()</TT>, which returns a file descriptor
open for reading and writing to Wily, or a negative number if
there's been some error.  <TT>client_connect()</TT> uses <TT>$WILYFIFO</TT>
if it is set.

<H2>RPC-style Interface</H2>
<H3>Opening, Closing and Checking the RPC interface</H3>

<DL>
<H4>Handle* rpc_init (int fd);</H4>
Create a new RPC handle to use file descriptor <TT>fd</TT>, which
was probably returned from <TT>client_connect</TT>

<P><TT>rpc_init</TT> cannot fail.

<H4>Bool rpc_isconnected(Handle*h);</H4>
Return whether or not <TT>h</TT> is still connected.  If the RPC
library starts receiving gibberish messages, it will cut the
connection.

<H4>void rpc_freehandle(Handle*h);</H4>
Release any resources used by <TT>h</TT>, and free <TT>h</TT>
itself.

<H3>Requests</H3>

<P>If there's any sort of failure, all of these functions return a
pointer to an error message, which is stored in a static buffer and
only guaranteed to remain valid until the next <TT>rpc_*</TT>
function is called.  After a failure, it's possible that the connection
to wily has been lost.  This should be checked using
<TT>rpc_isconnected</TT>

<P>If successful, these functions return <TT>(char*)0</TT>.


<H4><I>List existing windows</I>
<BR>char* rpc_list  (Handle*, char **bufptr);</H4>
If successful, allocates a string, 
and stores a pointer to it in <TT>bufptr</TT>.  It is the programmer's
responsibility to <TT>free(*bufptr)</TT>.
The string contains one line for each window currently open in Wily.
Each line contains the name of the window, some whitespace, and a
unique number which identifies the window.  The window identifiers
are not reused within an invocation of Wily.

<P>Below is some example output from <TT>rpc_list</TT>:

</PRE>

<H4><I>Open or create a window</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_new         (Handle*, char *s, Id*id, ushort backup);</H4>
Create or open window with name <TT>s</TT>.  If
Wily already has a window named 's', it uses that window,
otherwise it creates a new window.

<P>The identifier for the opened/created window will be stored in 
<TT>id</TT>.

<P>If this request creates (not just opens) the window, 
Wily will make sure backups are kept for the window (and indicate
when the window is dirty) if and only if <TT>backup</TT> is set.

<H4><I>Request events from a window</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_attach      (Handle*, Id w, ushort mask);</H4>
Asks Wily to send us events which happen in window <TT>w</TT>
and match event bitmask <TT>mask</TT>.

<P>Each window can be sending events to at most one remote process.
The window sends only events which match its event bitmask.
An event bitmask is formed  by ORing some combination of (<TT>WEexec, WEgoto, WEdestroy, WEreplace</TT>) (explained further below).

<P><TT>rpc_attach</TT> will
fail if <TT>w</TT> doesn't exist, or is already sending its
events somewhere else.

<P>To stop receiving events from a window,
use an <TT>rpc_attach</TT> with a <TT>mask</TT> of 0.

<H4><I>Change a window's name</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_setname     (Handle*, Id w, char *s);</H4>
Set the name of window <TT>w</TT> to <TT>s</TT>.

<H4><I>Change a window's "tools"</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_settools    (Handle*, Id w, char *s);</H4>
Set the tools section of <TT>w</TT> to <TT>s</TT>

<H4><I>Read data from a window</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_read                (Handle*, Id w, Range r, char*buf);</H4>
Read range <TT>r</TT> from <TT>w</TT> into <TT>buf</TT>,
which must have enough space (<TT>UTFmax * RLEN(r)</TT>).

<P>The range <TT>r</TT> means the Rune offsets in <TT>w</TT>
<TT>&gt;= r.p0</TT> and <TT>&lt; r.p1</TT>.  Don't forget
that each Rune will be potentially encoded in <TT>UTFmax</TT>
bytes.

<P><TT>rpc_read</TT> fails if
<TT>r</TT> is not fully contained in window <TT>w</TT>.
<TT>rpc_goto</TT> may be useful to obtain legal ranges.

<H4><I>Insert, delete or replace text</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_replace     (Handle*, Id w, Range r, char*s);</H4>
Replace range <TT>r</TT> in <TT>w</TT> with UTF string <TT>s</TT>

<P>Note that insertion and deletion are special
cases of replacement.

<H4><I>Ask Wily to execute a command</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_exec                (Handle*, Id w , char *s);</H4>
Cause Wily to act as though <TT>s</TT> were selected in
<TT>w</TT> with button 2.

<P>Note that builtin functions (e.g. <B>Del</B>) can
also be executed with <TT>rpc_exec</TT>.

<H4><I>Ask Wily to "goto" a file or location</I>
<BR>char*    rpc_goto                (Handle*, Id *w , Range* r, char*s, ushort flag);</H4>
Cause Wily to act as though <TT>s</TT> were selected in
<TT>w</TT> with button 3.

<P>If this makes Wily do a search within '*w', the start position
for the search is usually taken from '<TT>*r</TT>'.
The search can instead start from the current selection of the
file if <TT>r-&gt;p0 &gt; r-&gt;p1</TT>.  If there are multiple
views of the same file, one is chosen arbitrarily.

<P>If the search is successful, '<TT>*w</TT>' and '<TT>*r</TT>' are set to the window
and range found by the search.  The range found will be selected
and highlighted if and only if '<TT>flag</TT>' is set.

<P><B>Hint</B>: <TT>rpc_goto</TT> can be used to find useful
ranges for <TT>rpc_read</TT> and <TT>rpc_replace</TT>.  Don't forget that the search string
can be any address that Wily understands, e.g. <TT>:4</TT>  or   <TT>:,</TT>  or <TT> :.,</TT>

<H3>Events</H3>
<H4>int              rpc_event       (Handle*h, Msg *m);</H4>
Block until an event is received by <TT>h</TT> and fill
in <TT>m</TT>.  Returns 0 for success, -1 for failure.
After a successful call to <TT>rpc_event</TT>,
you will need to <TT>free(m->s)</TT>.

<H4>char *rpc_bounce(Handle *h, Msg *m)</H4>
Returns <TT>m</TT> to Wily.
Useful for events which we receive but we'd rather Wily
took the default action on.

<H4>Bool             rpc_event_iswaiting(Handle*h);</H4>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if <TT>rpc_event</TT> could be called
without needing to block.  Only useful if your program
is reading from other input sources as well. (e.g. see <TT>win.c</TT>)

<H2>Message-Passing Interface</H2>

<PRE>
struct Msg {
        Mtype   t;	/* message type */
        Id      m;      /* message */
        Id      w;      /* window */    
        Range   r;
        uchar   flag;
        char    *s;
};
</PRE>

<P>All the fields except the message
type are optional.  The string <TT>s</TT> is always null-terminated,
is in UTF format, must be a complete UTF sequence, 
and is of zero length if not being used.

<P>These are the message types declared in <TT>msg.h</TT>, with brief
descriptions, and important parameters:

<H3>Request/Reply/Error</H3>

<H4>WRerror(<TT>s</TT>) </H4>
Message type returned by wily if there's an error with
some request.  <TT>s</TT> contains an error message.  On the other
hand, if the request completes successfully wily returns a message with
message type one greater than the message type of the request.

<H4>WMlist</H4>
Asks wily to send a list of windows currently displayed.

<H4>WRlist(<TT>s</TT>)</H4>
Wily's reply to WMlist.  Includes a string containing
one line per active window.  Each line contains a name and an id (as a
textual number) separated by whitespace.

<H4>WMnew(<TT>s,flag</TT>)</H4>
Asks wily to create a window with
a given label (which may be an existing file).
If and only if <TT>flag</TT> is set, backups will be
kept for the new window.

<H4>WRnew(<TT>w</TT>)</H4>
The id of the newly created window.

<H4>WMattach(<TT>w,flag</TT>)</H4>
Asks wily to send to the client
events associated with this window, and matching
the event mask set in <TT>flag</TT>

<H4>WRattach()</H4>

<H4>WMdetach(<TT>w</TT>)</H4>
Asks wily to stop sending to the client
events associated with this window.

<H4>WRdetach()</H4>

<H4>WMsetname(<TT>w,s</TT>)</H4>
Change the name of this window.

<H4>WRsetname()</H4>

<H4>WMsettools(<TT>w,s</TT>)</H4>
Change the tools for this window.
Tools are simply words appearing in the
tag of a window, after the window name and
before the 'pipe' symbol.  They are (will be)
automatically maintained, i.e. they will be replaced
if accidentally deleted.

<H4>WRsettools()</H4><P>

<H4>WMread(<TT>w,r</TT>)</H4>
Read the text from <TT>w</TT> in range <TT>r</TT>.

<H4>WRread(<TT>s</TT>)</H4>
The requested text, as a UTF string.

<H4>WMreplace(<TT>w,r,s</TT>)</H4>
Replace the text from <TT>w</TT> in range <TT>r</TT> with UTF string
<TT>s</TT>

<H4>WRreplace()</H4><P>

<H4>WMexec(<TT>w,s</TT>)</H4>
Act as if <TT>s</TT> had been clicked with b2
in <TT>w</TT>

<H4>WRexec()</H4>

<H4>WMgoto(<TT>w,r,flag,s</TT>)</H4>
Act as if <TT>s</TT> had been clicked with B3 in <TT>w</TT> at
<TT>r</TT>.  If <TT>flag</TT> is set then "dot" is set by wily,
otherwise we return the window and range that would have been jumped
to, but don't actually change "dot".

<H4>WRgoto(<TT>w,r</TT>)</H4>
 The window and range we went to.

<H4>WMfencepost()</H4>
Not used for any message.  Messages with Mtype less than
<TT>WMfencepost</TT> are to do with our requests.  Messages with Mtype
greater than  <TT>WMfencepost</TT> are <EM>events</EM>.


<H3>Events</H3>


<P>These are the messages sent by Wily to clients who request
to be notified of events in a particular window using <TT>WMattach</TT>

<P>The event types are used to form a mask to be given as a
parameter to the <TT>WMattach</TT> request.  For example, to
request only exec and goto events, set 
<TT>m.f = WEexec|WEgoto</TT> before sending message <TT>m</TT>
<P>
<H4>WEexec(<TT>w,s</TT>)</H4>
<TT>s</TT> was selected with the middle (execute)
button somewhere in <TT>w</TT>

<H4>WEgoto(<TT>w,r,s</TT>)</H4>
 <TT>s</TT> was selected with the right (goto)
button at <TT>r</TT> in <TT>w</TT>

<H4>WEdestroy(<TT>w</TT>) </H4>
<TT>w</TT> has been destroyed.

<H4>WEreplace(<TT>w,r,s</TT>) </H4>
The text at <TT>r</TT> in <TT>w</TT> was
replaced by <TT>s</TT>.



<H3>Packing and Unpacking Messages</H3>

<H4>int  msg_size (Msg *m);</H4>
Returns the size of buffer that will be needed to "flatten"
<TT>m</TT>

<H4>void msg_flatten (Msg*m, char*buf);</H4>
"Flatten" <TT>m</TT> into <TT>buf</TT>, which must have enough storage
space allocated.

<H4>ulong    msg_bufsize     (char*buf);</H4>
Returns the total size of the flattened message starting at
<TT>buf</TT>.  Assumes that at least <TT>HSIZE</TT> bytes are stored in
<TT>buf</TT>.  A useful macro is <TT>#define FULLMSG(ptr,n) ( (n) >=
HSIZE &amp;&amp; (n) >= msg_bufsize(ptr) )</TT>

<H4>int              msg_init                (Msg*m, char*buf);</H4>
The reverse of <TT>msg_flatten</TT>.  Fills in the fields of 'm' using
the flat representation starting at <TT>buf</TT> <TT>Msg_init</TT>
assumes that <TT>buf</TT> holds the complete message.  <TT>m->s</TT>
will point to an area within <TT>buf</TT>, but <TT>buf</TT> itself is
not modified.

<H4>void             msg_print       (Msg *m);</H4>
Print a human-readable form of <TT>m</TT> to <TT>stderr</TT>
