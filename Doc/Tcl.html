<P>this is a package of tools for communicating with wily using the Tcl
library.  the file wily.c defines a thin veneer round wily's libmsg.

<P>this compiles with  wily-0.13.1[89] with tclversion 7.4.

<P>the files wtcl.c and wtk.c compile against wily.c to give a tclsh alike
with wily support called wtcl, and a wish alike with wily support called
wtk.

<P>the only addition to standard tcl/tk is the ``wily'' command.  this has
several subcommands
