What is Wily?

Wily's basic functions are to edit and search for text and to run commands.
It requires UNIX, X and a three-button mouse.  It is intended to eventually
be an integrated working environment for all tasks involving text.
It uses the mouse heavily.  It emphasises speed for experienced
users, but is probably simple to learn as it has very few concepts.

What state is it in?

Not finished yet, but probably ready for most people to use.  A few
people here (Basser) are using it pretty heavily already, but there's
still quite a lot of work remaining.  Grab it if you want to have a
look/play, but expect (and please mail me) bugs.  Please mail me
portability fixes (but not problems).  It's being jointly written on a
Solaris and a FreeBSD machine.
