<H2>Note for Sydney-ites</H2>
I'd be keen to demonstrate/explain Wily for interested folks in Sydney

<H2>Abstract:</H2>

<P>Wily is an emulation for the Unix/X environment of Acme <A
HREF="#pike95">[Pike95]</A> from Plan 9.  It combines most of the
features of text editor, window manager, file manager
and general user interface.
It exploits a three-button mouse and bitmapped display 
to provide a smooth, simple and powerful
environment for interacting with text of all kinds.

<P>Wily differs from most other editors in a number of areas.  Nearly
all operations are through mouse actions on text on the screen: there
are no menus, few "key bindings" and no "function keys".  Text is
usually displayed in a proportionally-spaced font, and is interpreted as
UTF8-encoded Unicode.  Mouse "chords" (combinations of mouse buttons)
are used extensively.  Wily's core functionality is almost totally
<B>un</B>configurable.  However, it is quite simple to extend Wily
using other programs, written in <EM>any</EM> language, both for simple
text-manipulation tasks, and to use Wily as a front-end for other
programs such as mail or news readers, or terminals.  <P>It is possible
(and intended) to "live" in wily as with other, more complicated
editors.

<P>The learning curve is steep, but short.  Once learnt, the interface
is sufficiently addictive that the author re-implemented Acme to work
under Unix, rather than coping with other editors.  Wily and Acme have a
small but growing number of addicts.

<H2><A NAME="appearance">Appearance</A></H2>

<IMG SRC="example.gif" width=798 height=264>

<P>Wily appears as one or more vertical columns, divided into windows
of scrolling text. Each column or window is headed by a thin horizontal
<I>tag</I>. The leftmost text of the tag is the name of the file or
directory the window represents. Other text in the tag are some words
useful as commands.

<P>The small square-ish box to the left of the tag is called the
<I>resize box</I>. If the resize box is filled, this indicates that the
text in the associated window has been modified since it was last read
from or written to disk.

<P>The text in the <I>body</I> of the window may represent a directory,
a file, the interface to some program like a news reader, or the output
from some program like <CODE>make</CODE>.

	<H3>Proportionally spaced, Unicode text</H3>

<P>Text is displayed in a propotionally spaced font by default. There
is a built in function to toggle with a monospace font (seen in the bottom-left
window in the example pictured), but there are
very few occasions when this is necessary or desirable.  In most cases
limiting a text editor to monospace fonts is blindly following the
hardware limitations of the 1960s.

<P>Text is read and written as 
<A HREF="http://www.stonehand.com/unicode/standard/utf8.html">UTF8-encoded</A>
<A HREF="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/doc/utf.html">Unicode</A>,
providing some support for editing multi-lingual and scientific text,
but remaining backwardly compatible with plain 7-bit ASCII text.
See <A HREF="http://www.cs.su.oz.au/~matty/9term/index.html">9term</A> for an example of another program with Unicode support,
with some screen shots.

<H2><A NAME="mouse">Basic Mouse Actions</A></H2>

<EM>Any</EM> text on the screen can be selected by dragging
with a mouse button.  Briefly, the left, middle and right mouse
buttons are used to select, execute or goto text.  In more detail:
<DL>
<DT>Left button<DD>highlights the text for later actions
<DT>Middle button<DD>executes the text as a command, e.g. selecting
	the word '<TT>make</TT>' will run the <TT>make</TT> command as if it were typed
	to the shell.  There is a small set of built-in functions
	(e.g. <TT>Undo</TT>, <TT>Redo</TT>, ) that
	are searched for first.  Wily arranges for text representing these functions
	to be on the screen when and where appropriate, although they can always
	be typed anywhere anytime.  Output from programs is captured and displayed
	in windows in Wily.

<DT>Right button<DD>attempts to <I>goto</I> the selected text.
	What this means depends on the text selected, but may
	involve opening a file or directory, or searching for a line
	number, regular expression or literal text.

	<P>Wily tries to parse the selected text as <CODE>filename:address</CODE>,
	where <CODE>address</CODE> may be a line number or <CODE>/regexp</CODE>.
	
	<P>Either or both of the filename and the <CODE>:address</CODE> may be recognized.
 
	<P>If Wily cannot recognise any of these forms, it searches for the
	next occurrence of the selected text in the current window.
</DL>

<P>Panes and columns can be moved and reshaped by clicking
or dragging in the <I>resize box</I> to the left of their tags.

<P>There are no menus, and few special keys
(page up, page down, arrow keys, Home, End, kill word, kill line, select
recently typed text).  All functions
are accessed through mouse actions on text.

<H2><A NAME="example">A short example</A></H2>

Sally has been using wily to develop a program called wily.

<UL>

<LI>She <I>clicks the middle mouse button</I> in the word
<CODE>make</CODE> somewhere in the tag of the window for her source
directory, <CODE>/src/wily/</CODE>.  Clicking the middle mouse
button in some text tells wily to <i>execute</i> that text.  In this
case wily runs <CODE>make</CODE> in another process.  The output
and errors from this process will appear in a window labelled
<CODE>/src/wily/+Errors</CODE>.  (The window will be created if
necessary).  Unfortunately there is an error: the output includes the
line <CODE>builtins.c:78: parse error before `)'</CODE>.

<LI>She <I>clicks the right mouse button</I> anywhere in the text
<CODE>builtins.c:78:</CODE>.  Clicking in some text with the rightmost
mouse button tells wily to <i>goto</I> that text.  A new window labelled
<CODE>/src/wily/builtins.c</CODE> is created if necessary, with line 78
centred and highlighted, and the cursor warps to this line.  Sally sees
that the last <CODE>)</CODE> on that line is unnecessary.

<LI>She <I>selects it with the left mouse button</I>, and while holding
this button down, <I>also clicks the middle mouse button</I> to cut out
the offending parenthesis.  <I>Cutting</I> and <i>pasting</i> text in
wily can be done with combinations of mouse keys.  This is <B>very</B>
quick and easy.  The resize box of the window is filled in, to indicate
that the file has been modified.

<LI>She <I>clicks the middle mouse button</I> in the word "Put" in the
window's tag.  Wily recognizes this as the name of the builtin function
to write the file to disk, and does so.  The resize box is cleared, to
indicate that the file is "clean".

<LI>She <I>clicks the middle mouse button</I> in the word
<CODE>make</CODE>, and the cycle begins again.

</UL>

<P>This whole interaction requires six mouse clicks and much less
time than the time to read about it.

<H3>Combinations of mouse buttons</H3>
The system does some things so that the user doesn't need to place
the mouse accurately.  Double-clicking with the left mouse button
selects a word, a line or a piece of text delimited by quotes, braces or
brackets.  With the middle or right button, a click inside a selection
will be expanded to that selection, or a click inside a word that can be
recognised as a command or address will be expanded to that word.

<P>Simultaneous combinations of mouse buttons
(Mouse <I>chords</I>) are used for cutting and pasting.  To move some
text from one place to another, it first is selected by dragging with
the left mouse button.  While holding this button down, if the middle
button is also pressed, the text is <I>cut</I>.  The text can later be
pasted into place by holding the left button and then clicking the right
button.  This action is easier done than said, and is much quicker than
searching for a menu entry.

<P>A mouse chord is also used as a short-hand for the idiom of
executing a command with some argument.  While clicking with the
middle button in the command, if the leftbutton is then pressed,
the most recently selected text is given as an argument to the
command.  For example, one could point to a program variable,
click the middle and left buttons on the name of some simple
program, and get a list showing all the places that variable
occurs.  Clicking with the right button on any of the occurrences
on that list will open the relevant file at the correct line.

<P>The mouse cursor is often warped to where the program predicts the next
action is likely to take place.  For example, after opening a file at a particular
address, the cursor is warped to that position of that file.

<P>The escape key selects any text typed since the last cursor movement,
making it easier to select with the mouse.

	<H2>Undo/Redo</H2>

<P>Wily provides a full Undo/Redo history for each window.

	<H2>Window Positioning</H2>

<P>Newly created windows are placed by the program, not the user.
While it is possible for the user to reposition or resize the window after
it is created, window-positioning heuristics generally make
such positioning unnecessary.

<H2><A NAME="extensions">Extensions</A></H2>

Wily has no extension language, but is easy to connect to other
UNIX programs.

<H3>Program output is useful</H3>

<P>The output (both <CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE>) of
any commands run from wily will appear in a wily window, where it may
be useful.  For example, the author uses the shell functions <code>sg</code>
and <code>def</code>.  <code>sg</code> (short for source grep) is
defined as <CODE>fn sg {agrep -w -n $* *.[ch]}</CODE>, <CODE>def</CODE>
as <CODE>fn def {grep -n '^'^$1 *.c /dev/null}</CODE>.  To find the
definition of some C function, the author clicks with the left button
in the name of the function, and does a middle-left button combination
on the word <CODE>def</CODE>.  The output from <CODE>def</CODE>
will appear in a wily window, and be something like
<CODE>/usr/gary/src/dir/file.c:243 function(int arg, char* otherarg)</CODE>.
Clicking here with the right mouse button will then open the file if necessary,
and move to and highlight the correct line.  The function <CODE>sg</CODE>
operates similarly, listing all occurrences of some identifier.  Note that
it would be simple to modify these functions to operate with other languages
(HTML, Java, ...) and that they could be written in any language the
user chooses.

<H3>Filter programs</H3>
	<P> Commands beginning with
	|, &gt; or &lt; operate on the most recent selection.  They
	either pipe it through a command, send it to a
	command, or replace it with the output of a
	command.  For example, to reformat a paragraph, select
	it (using the left button), then click anywhere in the text
	<CODE>|fmt</CODE>.  <CODE>fmt</CODE> will be executed,
	with its input taken from the current selection, and its output
	replacing the current selection.

<P>Programs may also be used to filter text in wily windows.  If a command
starts with the pipe symbol <code>|</code>, it uses the most recently
selected wily text as input and output.  Indenting, formatting, html tagging
can all be done using standard Unix tools, or tools written by the user in
any language.  Simply select some text, and click with the middle mouse
button in <CODE>|cmd</CODE>.

For example, here is the author's file <CODE>lib/html/guide</CODE>:

<PRE>
|title |h1 |h2 |h3 |h4
|italic |emph |strong |bold |code |href prog.html |name remote
|fmt &gt;spell |blanks2P
</PRE>

<H3>Wily as a front-end</H3>
Longer-running processes may instead open
a socket to wily, which can be used to send requests or receive
events.  One example of this is the program <CODE>win</CODE>,
which provides a simple terminal within Wily.
(For details refer to <A HREF="#cap95a">[Cap95a]</A>)

<P><A HREF="pythonpaper.html">Python</A>
and Perl bindings for this message interface are available.

<P>Mail and news readers or code browsers should be fairly simple to
write using Wily as their front end.  All of these programs would
operate in a familiar fashion (left mouse button selects, middle button
executes, right button does a "goto").

<H2>No confirmations</H2>

When you close a file that wily knows contains changes, it doesn't
bother you with a confirmation dialog, but does a backup of the file
and prints a warning message
in case you've made a mistake.  This is quicker in the common case that
you <B>do</B> want to discard the changes, is simple to recover from
if you <B>have</B> made a mistake, and <B>eliminates</B> the mistake
of confirming a deletion that shouldn't have been confirmed.

<H2><A NAME="implementation">The Implementation</A></H2>

Wily is a single-threaded event-driven server process.  The events it
waits for are keyboard and mouse actions, and output arriving
on sockets shared with child processes.  Text display is handled
by text widgets.

<H3>Child Processes</H3>

<P>To execute a command that isn't built in, the wily server forks a child,
which modifies its execution environment, and <CODE>exec</CODE>s the
required command.

<P>The child sets its current directory to the directory the command was
invoked from.  The child's file descriptors are set so that
<CODE>stdin</CODE> is redirected from <CODE>/dev/null</CODE>, and
<CODE>stdout</CODE> and <CODE>stderr</CODE> are redirected to a file
descriptor the server listens to for output.

<P>The parent adds the file descriptors passed to the child to a list of
file descriptors that it monitors for output, and remembers which directory
that stream is associated with, so that output will appear in an appropriate window.

<P>More sophisticated client processes can open a socket to
wily and send (and receive messages).  The idea here is that wily
provides the "look and feel" of the user interface, with various
client programs providing different data (mail, news, debugger...),

<H3>Code bloat (not!)</H3>
Wily's source code (excluding some libraries from Bell Labs) takes
7600 lines of code, or 3100 counting only lines with semicolons.
The binary (<TT>ELF 32-bit MSB executable SPARC Version 1, dynamically linked, stripped</TT>) is 150k (c.f. 234k for vi, 2044k for xemacs).
Wily typically takes less memory to run than Xterm.

<H2>Strengths, Weaknesses and Further Work</H2>

<P>The things the author misses most when using another editor are:
mouse chording for cut and paste (alternatives seem very awkward),
opening a file to a particular line with a single mouse click, and editing
in a proportional font.

<P>Some of wily's strengths may also be seen as weaknesses:  heavy
exploitation of bitmapped terminal and three button mouse mean wily is
unusable on glass and paper teletypes.  The terse mouse command language is
opaque and even intimidating for new users.

<P>The author is very interested in cooperating with any HCI researchers
interested in comparing the usability and/or ease of learning of this editor
with more traditional ones, or in comparing mouse-based and keyboard-based
editors.

<P>Wily is not as robust or efficient as the author would like.

<H2><A NAME="History">History</A></H2>

Wily is a reimplementation of Acme <A HREF="#pike95">[Pike95]</A>
for the Unix/X environment.  Acme itself was heavily inspired by the
Oberon <A href="#Wirt89">[Wirt89]</A> user interface.  A port was not
possible because the Acme implementation relies on Alef
<A HREF="#Win95">[Win95]</A>(a concurrent
programming language not widely available) and non-portable features
of Plan 9 <A HREF="#Pike95a">[Pike95a]</A>.

<P>The name "wily" derives from Wile E. Coyote, an avid user of
Acme products.
