<BODY><H1>Acme Vs. <A HREF="index.html">Wily</A></H1>

The following is a side-by-side comparison of Acme under Plan 9 vs. Wily
under Unix.
See <A HREF="http://www.cs.su.oz.au/~gary/wily/">http://www.cs.su.oz.au/~gary/wily/</A>
for more docs.

<P>Wily extensions and differences include:

<UL>
<LI> sam-like command redirections: &lt;, &gt;, | - operate on the current selection
<LI> you can export rc functions and variables to wily
<LI> no confirmations - automatic backup of dirty files
<LI> no warnings when using New to create a new file
<LI> black (dirty) resize box is more visible in wily
<LI> long-running processes can open a socket to wily
<LI> HISTORY mechanism
<LI> Indent, Dotfiles, Clear and Anchor builtins
<LI> Exit in acme is called Quit in wily
<LI> Zerox in acme is called Split in wily
<LI> acme executes a B2B1 command in the context of the command whereas
  wily does it in the context of the argument
<LI> acme selects B2 output
<LI> window tags scroll horizontally
<LI> contracting labels using environment variables. For example, if a window
  represents <TT>/u13/pgrad/gary/src/</TT>, on the screen it will show up as <TT>$h/src/</TT>
  if you set <TT>h=/usr/pgrad/gary</TT>
<LI> if you hit Return <I>immediately</I> after selecting some tag text with the
  Escape key, it acts as if you'd clicked it with button 2, so typing
  'echo fish', Escape, Return executes that command.
<LI> each line in <TT>$WILYTOOLS</TT> or <TT>$HOME/.wilytools</TT> can contain either a comment
  (starts with whitespace or '#') or a regexp, then a tab, then some tools
  (i.e. some text) which will be appended into the tag of any window whose
  label matches the regexp.  The <I>first</I> regexp match wins.
<LI> editing the label of a window does "the right thing" if you then B2 on Get
<LI> you can set the wily file, directory, column and main tags, via <TT>$WFILETAG</TT>,
  <TT>$WDIRTAG</TT>, <TT>$WCOLTAG</TT> and <TT>$WMAINTAG</TT>
</UL>

Wily does not have the following Acme capabilities:

<UL>
<LI> the Font builtin should be able to take an argument - this can be fixed
<LI> Dump/Load not implemented yet (could be done by an external program)
<LI> acme makes the right column skinnier - good for guide files
<LI> there is no equivalent to <TT>/mnt/acme</TT>
<LI> ID, Incl, Local, Send, Sort not implemented
</UL>

A striking similarity :-)

<UL>
<LI> the View will scroll (with lots of ugly flicker) while selecting,
  to allow you to select an area larger than the View.
</UL>
