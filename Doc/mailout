That's a whole lot of stat-ing going on.  Every time
a window opens for .wilytools, and every time
a directory opens for .wilydirhide.

A cheesy hack would be to look at those files when
we open or write them from inside wily, i.e. check the
label of the file we write/open to see if it is magic.  strcmp
should be cheaper than stat
