Title:          Wily - a simple, powerful, mouse-based text environment
Version:        0.13.23 [November 1996]
Entered-date:   November 1996
Description:    Interact in a general way with text on the screen using a mouse.
		Instead of menus or control keys, clicking on text with the
		middle mouse button executes it, clicking on text with the
		right mouse button "goes to" a file, directory, string or
		regular expression.  
		Wily was written by programmers for programmers: there
		are very few rules and almost no exceptions.
		The learning curve is steep but short,
		and very few people have used wily for a few hours and
		gone back to another editor.
		Wily is an emulation for Unix and X of Acme which only
		works in the Plan 9 environment.  Acme was inspired chiefly
		by Oberon.
