What is wily?

What does "wilydiag: File exists: can't open fifo" mean?

	Wily opens and listens on a fifo in /tmpin case some program
	tries to communicate with it.  If you're not doing anything
	tricky like that, it won't get used at all.  Ordinarily wily
	cleans the fifo up when it exits, but if something dire happens
	Wily may not get a chance to clean up.	The fifo will be named
	$WILYFIFO if that is defined, otherwise /tmp/wilyUSER$DISPLAY,
	where USER is your login name.	Just remove it and restart wily
	to be able to use wily messages.

Why does my compiler/editor/whatever complain about illegal
characters?  The line looks fine to me."

	Chances are that you've managed to enter a control character
	accidentally, and the font you're using doesn't display control
	characters. The easiest way to check is to select the line (or other
	text) that's causing the complaint, and click on "|cat -v" (or some
	other program that can display control characters, such as vis or od). I
	find ^A the most common offender.

Why does Wily have to do its own window management?

Funky B3 expansion allows some letters, not others?
	To quote rob (it was originally rob's comment, wasn't it?): "Hard to
	get absolutely right." The problem is that you can have pretty much
	everything in a filename apart from \0, but usually you want it to
	pick sensible strings. It's not just filenames, after all, but also
	identifiers in programs. After all, Acme is primarily a programmer's
	tool, because there aren't any other kinds of Plan 9 user. :-) Plus,
	most of them are shell metacharacters (in rc).

	The set you want to match varies from instance to instance, so
	it's pretty much an arbitrary choice. Sometimes you lose. Some
	justification would be good for the docs, though. Anyone know
	why "*" is considered a valid character? Hmmm. Ones not in the
	above list are "#$^*_-:~,./".  Of these, "~./" are parts of
	common filenames (~steve/x.c), "#$-:,."  are part of the syntax
	for expressing an Acme address, and "_" is a common identifier
	character. That just leaves "^*". I suspect these are allowed
	because they're commonly used as part of a regexp search.

Why does it take so long to load my [mumble]-meg file?
	Blame steve.

What about a Win 3.1/95/NT port?
	Gary's not likely to do it because he doesn't have
	a development environment for Win (or know much
	about the Win environment (or want to))
	
	It may not be as useful under windows as under Unix
	because you won't have the same command-line toolbox 
	(sed, grep, glimpse, ...)
	
	There's a Win version of sam, which presumably means
	there's a Win version of libg (libg.dll?).  Starting from
	that would probably make the port much easier.
