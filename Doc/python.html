<H2>Summary</H2>
Create a <TT>Connection</TT>, use it to create and manipulate 
Wily windows.

<P>See <A HREF="pythonpaper.html">pythonpaper.html</A> for a discussion of the design.
(Unfortunately out of date).

<H2>Creating a Connection</H2>
<PRE>
import wily
con = wily.Connection()
</PRE>

<H2>methods of a Connection object</H2>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>list()</TT><DD>
Returns the names and IDs of all open windows.
The values are returned in one big string, with names and IDs separated
by a tab, and each (name,id) pair on its own line.
<PRE>
listing = con.list()
lines = string.split(listing, '\n')
winid = {}
for line in lines[:-1]:
	[name,id] = string.split(line, '\t')
	winid[name] = string.atoi(id)
</PRE>
... will give you a dictionary mapping names to numeric ids.

<DT><TT>win(name:string, isBackedUp:integer)</TT><DD>
Returns an integer window identifier, to be used for later operations on the window

<DT><TT>event()</TT><DD>
returns an event tuple <TT>(w, t, r0, r1, s)</TT>, whose fields are:
	<DL>
	<DT><TT>w</TT><DD>
	window identifier
	<DT><TT>t</TT><DD>
	event type
	<DT><TT>r0, r1</TT><DD>
	affected range
	<DT><TT>s</TT><DD>
	string
	</DL>

The meaning (if any) of the values of <TT>r0</TT>, <TT>r1</TT> and <TT>s</TT> depend
on the event type '<TT>t</TT>'

<DT><TT>eventwouldblock()</TT><DD>
If <TT>eventwouldblock()</TT> returns true, calling <TT>event()</TT> might have to wait.
If <TT>eventwouldblock()</TT> returns false, calling <TT>event()</TT> would return immediately
because an event is already queued up and waiting.

<DT><TT>bounce(tuple)</TT><DD>
Called with an event tuple as returned by <TT>event()</TT>.  Returns <TT>None</TT>.  Used for returning an event we want Wily to handle instead of us.

<DT><TT>attach(w:integer, mask:integer)</TT><DD>
'<TT>w</TT>' is a window identifier as obtained by <TT>new()</TT> or<TT> list()</TT>.
'<TT>mask</TT>' is a bitmask of event types.
Sets the mask of events to be sent to us.

<DT><TT>setname(w:integer, s:string)</TT><DD>
Set <TT>w</TT>'s name to '<TT>s</TT>'

<DT><TT>settools(w:integer, s:string)</TT><DD>
Set <TT>w</TT>'s tools to '<TT>s</TT>'

<DT><TT>read(w:integer, from:integer, to:integer)</TT><DD>
returns a (UTF) string

<DT><TT>replace(w:integer, from:integer, to:integer, s:string)</TT><DD>
replace the text in '<TT>w</TT>' from '<TT>from</TT>' to '<TT>to</TT>' with '<TT>s</TT>'

<DT><TT>run(w:integer, s:string)</TT><DD>
has the same effect as sweeping '<TT>s</TT>' with B2  in window '<TT>w</TT>'

<DT><TT>goto(w:integer, from:long, to:long, s:string, flag:integer)</TT><DD>
has the same effect as sweeping '<TT>s</TT>' with B3  in window '<TT>w</TT>',
and starting any search at range(<TT>from,to</TT>), except that we only
warp and select text if '<TT>flag</TT>' is set.
<BR>Returns a tuple (<TT>w:integer, from:long, to:long</TT>),
which represents the window and selection that was
opened.
</DL>

<H2>Constants</H2>
<TT>GOTO</TT>, <TT>EXEC</TT>, <TT>DESTROY</TT>
and <TT>REPLACE</TT> are event bitmask values, useful for comparing to
the event type returned by <TT>event()</TT>, and for setting the bitmask in
<TT>attach()</TT>.
