<H2>The Wily Window Manager?</H2>

<P>Window management is probably the biggest open problem with Wily,
probably because there's no real <I>solution</I>, only heuristics.

<P>The first iteration of Wily creatied a bunch of separate X windows
and let the window manager handle arranging them.  This seems a more
modular, tool-based approach.  However, bitter experience showed that
most existing window managers just don't cut it when you're quickly
creating and deleting lots of windows.  Acme's window management,was
much better.

<P>The logical solution then would be to write an X window manager that
works like the window management in Acme.  However:

<UL>
<LI>Writing a window manager requires knowing a _lot_ more about X than
I ever want to know

<LI> Either the wily windows would need to be separate processes,
communicating probably via some sort of X IPC (more arcane X'ery), or
libXg would need to be modified to allow multiple windows (O who will
save me from this plague of X?)

<LI> This sort of window manager would probably _not_ be appropriate
for managing the other windows normally on the desktop.
</UL>

<P>So Wily is designed to be run in one big window, and it does its own
window management within that.  It's a bit of a hack, but probably the
best solution for the moment.

<P>Still, I hope it shouldn't be too hard to remove the "Wily is managing
all the windows" assumption from the code if some brave soul solves the
problems mentioned above.
