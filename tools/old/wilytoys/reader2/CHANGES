Newsreader has been significantly improved, to the point where I actually
use it for reading news. It's got a long way to go, but I can actually bear
to use it, so it can't be all that bad.

Both readers give feedback when they're loading - makes it slightly
less stressful watching the newsreader load, anyway.

Addresses are "parsed", for want of a better word, to give name or
email address in the message lists.

*BUG WARNING* In at least one case, I've noticed that this appears to
have lost mail in a race condition. Faces announced that new mail had
arrived, I did a commit, and nothing new appeared. :-( I'm not aware
of this happening more than once, but how do you tell? I recommend
using a .forward file or some similar mechanism to keep a separate
copy of your mail, so that you've got a day or so's backlog in case someone
claims something went missing. I don't know how to reproduce this,
so I've got no idea how to fix it. Right now, I'm not too worried - no one
else has appeared to send me anything which has vanished, and the
message I did lose was from my boss. :-)


Added lots more assertions and a DEBUG option for the Makefile, which
produces lots of gibberish.

Added "next" and "prev" commands, for advancing through the mailbox.
This occasioned a change in how it determines which window to display
a message in. The rule is:
	- if you next/prev in an article window, you'll re-use that window,
	and get the next/previous article according to the number of the
	article in that window.
	- if you next/prev in the list window, you'll get a new window, and
	it'll give you the next/previous article according to the line currently
	selected in the list. (BUG: doesn't change *which* item in the list is
	currently selected; this is because that causes a cursor warp, too).
	- If you B3 on a subject line, you get a new window for the article
	indicated.

A News reader is included. This should read groups and articles ok,
and allows you to post articles or reply via email. It works, but the
behaviour of "next" and "prev" is broken. Right now, it uses
.testnewsrc instead of .newsrc, because it's too broken for daily
use.

When posting a mail message, changes the tag to "Sending...", so you
know something is happening.
0.1 -> 0.2
========

Filters out most common garbage headers (toggle this with allheaders).

Can delete/undelete/save multiple messages, by sweeping them.

[Un]delete is a lot less effort on the screen updates.

Commit now writes changes back to the mailbox, without quitting. Doesn't
read in new mail, though.

Rescan reads in any new mail that has arrived. Doesn't write any current
changes, though.

Rescans your mailbox for new mail automatically. Does this every 60
seconds, by default. You have to hack mail.h to change this...

If you're running it in non-multiart mode (default), then it tries to avoid
trashing your composition windows when you pull up a message window.

savefile has a default parameter: $SAVEFILE if set, or $HOME/mbox
otherwise.

Sets the title of article windows to just mailboxname/msgnum, because
the From: lines are too long.

Uses MAXPATHLEN instead of FILENAME_MAX, because FILENAME_MAX
is way too small on some machines.
