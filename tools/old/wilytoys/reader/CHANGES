0.1 -> 0.2
========

Filters out most common garbage headers (toggle this with allheaders).

Can delete/undelete/save multiple messages, by sweeping them.

[Un]delete is a lot less effort on the screen updates.

Commit now writes changes back to the mailbox, without quitting. Doesn't
read in new mail, though.

Rescan reads in any new mail that has arrived. Doesn't write any current
changes, though.

Rescans your mailbox for new mail automatically. Does this every 60
seconds, by default. You have to hack mail.h to change this...

If you're running it in non-multiart mode (default), then it tries to avoid
trashing your composition windows when you pull up a message window.

savefile has a default parameter: $SAVEFILE if set, or $HOME/mbox
otherwise.

Sets the title of article windows to just mailboxname/msgnum, because
the From: lines are too long.

Uses MAXPATHLEN instead of FILENAME_MAX, because FILENAME_MAX
is way too small on some machines.
