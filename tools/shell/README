Some simple C programs to use as wrappers around shell
scripts to interact with Wily.

Having to know window id's is pretty cumbersome, I know,
and I'm open to suggestions on how to improve things.

Wins
	print list of 'filename winid' lines to stdout
Wexec cmd id
	Execute cmd (as if selected with b2), in context of id
Wgoto path id
	Goto 'path' (as if selected with b3), in context of id


# NB this is *guaranteed* _not_ to compile "out of the box",
you'll need a Makefile that isn't stupid, like the current one.
